## Getting Sassy with CSS ##

### December 31st 2017 ###
- Websites are getting complex and CSS isn't enough.
- Lots of repetition is happening with CSS.
- The main mission of SASS is to remove this repetition using nesting, variables, better selectors, mixins, inline imports and so on.
- *Compiling SASS*: `$ sass source_dir output_dir`
- *Running SASS*: `$ sass sass/application.scss css/application.css`
